# Making Magic client

This repo is for the client side of my project Making Magic, a [Magic the Gathering deck builder](http://magic.wizards.com/). I'm using this project as a place to experiment and learn some new front end technologies while having fun with a game that I've always enjoyed. I'm currently using React and LESS and plan to add Redux and D3 in the near future.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
